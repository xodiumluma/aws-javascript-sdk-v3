## Description

SDK for JS DynamoDB client (Node.js/Browser/React Native)

<fullname>Amazon DynamoDB</fullname>

<p>DynamoDB is a managed, serverless NoSQL database service that's fast, predictable, performant and scalable. It takes care of managing a distributed database - you can forget about hardware rollouts, setup, configuration, replicas, software updates or scaling clusters</p>
<p>Create database tables that can store and retrieve data of any amount and serve any level of request traffic. Scale up and down demand without downtime/performance impact. Use AWS Management Console to monitor resource utilisation and performance KPIs.</p>
<p>DynamoDB spreads data and traffic for your tables over sufficient servers to cater to our thoroughput and storage needs while keeping consistently performant. Your data is stored on SSDs and automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones in an AWS Region, thus giving you high availability and data durability</p>
